# ediassembler

My own disassembler written in Python. 
I'm doing this project because I got curious on how disassemblers work. So what better way to learn than doing it yourself?

## Roadmap / Goals

Current: Simple read only disassembler for x86 architecture

Future goals:
Architecture Detection
Debugger tools
Visualization + APIs for visualization support
